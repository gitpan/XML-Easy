NAME

XML::Easy - XML processing with a clean interface

DESCRIPTION

This distribution includes modules relating to the processing, parsing,
and serialisation of XML data.  It is oriented towards the use of XML
to represent data for interchange purposes, rather than the use of XML
as markup of principally textual data.  It does not perform any schema
processing, and does not interpret DTDs or any other kind of schema.
It adheres strictly to the XML specification, in all its awkward details,
except for the aforementioned DTDs.

The XML::Easy module supplies functions that parse and serialise XML data
according to the XML 1.0 specification.  The functions are implemented
in C for performance, with a pure Perl backup version (which has good
performance compared to other pure Perl parsers) for systems that can't
handle XS modules.

The XML::Easy::Syntax module supplies Perl regular expressions
encompassing the grammar of XML 1.0, except for document type declarations
and DTDs.  They can be used to construct an XML parser, but it is
generally recommended to use a pre-existing parser (as supplied in
XML::Easy) when doing ordinary XML processing.  This module is most
useful when doing irregular things with XML.

The XML::Easy::Element class represents XML data trees in abstract form,
without any irrelevant detail resulting from the textual syntax.  This is
a suitable form for application code to manipulate an XML representation
of application data.
